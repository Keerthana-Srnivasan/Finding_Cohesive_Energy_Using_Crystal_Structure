# Finding_Cohesive_Energy_Using_Crystal_Structure

A linear regression model that can predict the cohesive energy of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen molecules based on their lattice structure! Unfortunately, only the lattice points were included into the data frame, and the model is being iterated to take the lattice angles into account.
